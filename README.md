# Description


## How to install
To install this webapp, you only have to clone this repository by entering the following command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/TomasS666/real-time-web-1920```

or this command if you want to clone the repo into your current folder:

```git clone https://github.com/TomasS666/real-time-web-1920 ./```

or you can download the zip file or something similar by clicking on the green button on the top-right position of every repo.


## Concept
Your two year concert tour got canceled because a global pandemic? No problem, we got you covered with this new Realtime webapp, a central place to host your events online. Register, add your upcoming shows, edit shows, and interact via a live stream with your audience. 
You can even see your audience crowd growing live. This way, you could be anywhere and be safe, yet be closer to your fans than ever before. 

## API
At this moment, I have a little API of my own. I wanted to either make more endpoints in the future to request and query more specific data, but I didn't get there unfortunately. Right now I serve JSON from an endpoint ```/shows/``` which returns 

I started out with serveral ideas, but wasn't all quite what I had in mind and I was struggling with getting on the right track with a good and realistic idea.

### Socket events
#### Artist events
* Add show
* Delete show

#### Visitor events
* Join room (when connecting to a namespace by hitting the visitor route : ```/show/visitor/{ predefined room_id } ```

#### Server events

### Events which require more explaination
#### Visitor
* ```show is deleted``` : when the artist removes a show it goes a little different then POSTING. The DELETE method is not supported in HTML5 forms. To my surprise. (You learn all the time). So when I delete one of my shows as an Artist, I check the clicked target within the show list > when it's a button within the show, I use the room_id as identifier because other data is left out on purpose, I emit that room id directly to

## Data manipulation
* Adding users
* User roles with different rights
* Video and audio streaming
* Realtime show updates with change streams
* Deleting shows and communicating that to clients
* ~Artist / genre following for show recommendations~

## Features
* Live crowd ( D3 appending a crowd of people )
* Shows were first rendered server side at entrance of the site, now the shows it's getting fetched in the client from my endpoint which serves the show data without objectId from the db to avoid vulnerabilities. And then it gets appended to the DOM. It's slower, it's not performant, but this was my way to keep an initial state of data which I can use to differ from incoming changes. The thing that makes me proud is that it's from a truthy source in my opinion because: client fetches data dat comes out of the database, server listens to change in database with a stream, if a change occured, I check the change operation and then I emit the fullDocument of the change over sockets to the clients. So data comes from the database anyway. If the client refreshed, it


## Micro features / interactions


## Wishlist
* Editing shows
* Show countdown
* Scalable solution

* Ticket system, wanted to try Ticketmaster API.


## Known bugs

### Browser Support getUserMedia and constraints
There was a lot of trouble with getting ```javascript navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)``` up and running on multiple devices and browsers. So I used a [polyfill used by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia).

And tested that in multiple browsers, localy and deployed with http and https. And although it's supported almost everywhere, it's still not implemented to work everywhere. There are still bugs I would like to get out in the future. But in Chrome, Firefox and Safari on certain devices it works. And that's good enough at this time. It works on my Huawei p20 mate lite in the chrome browser. It works on Desktop chrome, firefox and I think Safari. It doesn't work yet on Edge, while Edge should support it, but I couldn't resolve this yet. It's sadly not supported on IE. 

### Bug peerOffer
To be very short, the ability to stream video and audio to other users is based on WebRTC and peer connections. The basic flow goes something like this: 

1. host / artist connects because it hits a route with a script that requests the user to enable their hardware for video and audio. 
1. Or! A visitor hits another route first with a specific id to join the show which is not hosted yet because the host isn't connected.

2. When a visitor hits the route, it's connected to that namespace because I set the req.params.id as the namespace. When that visitor connects, an event is send to the server. The server then in turn emits an event that a visitor is connected / watching specifically to the set host / broadcaster. If a broadcaster isn't set yet, it's just waiting there until a broadcaster is set. (required just a little if statement I oversaw) thanks to Ramon I got that working.

3. The broadcaster gets notified with an event that someone is watching, then it makes a new peerConnection instance, sets it's localDescription and then emits that back to the server.

4. The server sends it to the visitor which connected. A peerconnection instance is made there as well.

## Future features
* Custom stages
* More interaction and micro-interactions during the show
* Sky in show based on weather conditions or clients local time
* Ticket system for shows
* Better authentication, especially when joining a namespace
* Improvements on DOM manipulation
* Better scalability

## Acknowledgements
Robin, Ramon, Robert, Nick, Laurens, Guido, and possibly others for good ideas, helping with my concept, mental support.

This blog for understanding the barebones of WebRTC, peer connections and how to combine that with Socket.io.

Gonna test it to try the peers, and then write my own logic. I will have to add my whole own strategy because the stream is gonna be a one-side communication.

Big props for r2schools, for giving me the knowledge to get my mongodb replica set up and running localy. Was a pain at first, but because of this tutorial I totally got it: 

[Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJo7nr9xdrQ)  
[His Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjMKqt0sYMkBEfFg4YtqUdg)

Thanks to this tutorial I finally got most of it working
I was concerned It wouldn't work out anymore. Because I kinda had a two way communication and I wanted it to go to one-to-many.
What happens during the show with streaming is largely based on this. I understand what is happening, I build my own logic and things around it, but for getting the streams up and running with one-to-many peerconnections, I made use of this code.
